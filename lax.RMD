# Problem

I have not yet demonstrated any of the "Bayesian" flavor of analysis,
and this is intended to be my first go at it.

```{r setup, echo=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("rjags")
library("readxl")
print("Hello World")

laxData <- read_excel("2015-2019 Combined Lacrosse Statistics.xlsx", sheet)


```
